**TrackMyCourse** helps you stay organized while learning from YouTube playlists.

Instead of passively watching videos and forgetting your progress, you can turn any playlist into a structured online course. The extension integrates directly into YouTube, showing a progress bar, completion percentage, watched and total duration, and checkmarks for finished videos — giving you a clear view of your learning journey.

## Why TrackMyCourse?

YouTube is a powerful place for self-learning — from coding tutorials to full university lectures.  
But since YouTube is designed for entertainment, not structured courses, it’s easy to lose progress, skip videos, or lose consistency.

**TrackMyCourse** solves this by adding a clean progress-tracking layer to YouTube playlists, showing completion percentage, durations, and checkmarks to keep your learning organized, consistent, and motivating.

_Ready to use TrackMyCourse?_ [Install now](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/trackmycourse-track-youtu/eojbembojnleniamokihimgjikmpahin) and start tracking your playlists.
